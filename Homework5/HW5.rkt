;; A Rank is an exact non-negative integer
;; Interpretation:
;; Rank is the length of right spine of a node
;;
;; A [LeftistHeapNode X] is one of:
;; -- (make-none)
;; -- (make-heap-node X Rank [LeftistHeapNode X] [LeftistHeapNode X])
;; with invariant:
;; 1- the element in each node is no larger than the elements in its children
;; 2- the rank of left child is at large or euaql than the rank of right child
